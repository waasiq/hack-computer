# 💻 Hack Computer 
Custom Implementation of hack computer from nand2tetris course. 

## 📝 Description
Hack is a 16-bit computer designed for the nand2tetris course that is meant to be simple yet Turing complete.  A complete description of the working of computer is given in docs. 

## 📚 Documentation
Currently under development. The documentation can be found in docs folderç

## 📦 Usage
The software necessary to run the HDL files in the computer can be found at [nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/software). The software is available for all major operating systems. The chip logic resides in .HDL files and can be loaded into a hardware simulator and the working can be observed. The computer can be tested by loading the .tst files into the hardware simulator. The computer can be used to run .asm files by loading the .asm files into the assembler and loading the outputted .hack files into the computer.

Additionally the software is also available in tools foler.

## ✔️ Disclaimer
This repository is made to showcase my own implementation and understanding of the computer. The computer is designed as a part of the nand2tetris course and the course material is not available in this repository. The course material can be found at [nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/).
